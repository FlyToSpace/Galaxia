# Galaxia
**Galaxia** is a cleanroom replacement for **Galaxy space**, **Galacticraft**, 
and **Amun-Ra** made purely for **GT:New Horizons**.
It improves on where they left off conceptually, 
focuses on advanced rocketry, interplanetary travel and automation, as well as adding 
a bunch of new and interesting features for space exploration. 

[This document](<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I0_qtxRzEGk6KiOuNXg74zO9CaGzLLQCIhR4LTER1zo/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0>) covers all mechanics and features that are added by this mod
