Galaxia is a cleanroom replacement for Galaxy space, Galacticraft, 
and Amun-Ra made purely for GT:NH that improves on where they left off conceptually, 
focuses on advanced rocketry, interplanetary travel and automation, as well as adding 
a bunch of new and interesting features for space exploration. 

This document covers all mechanics and features that are added by this mod.
